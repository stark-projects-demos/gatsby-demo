## Stark for Developers - Gatsby Demo

This project shows how you can use Stark's GitHub integration to scan a page for accessibility issues. It's built off of our [TeamSync demo website](https://teamsync-stark.webflow.io/) which is dropped into a [Gatsby Starter](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/quick-start/) project.

### Development

1. Run `npm install` to get all of the dependencies.
2. Run `npm run develop` to build a local version of the site.

### Build

1. Run `npm run clean` to clear out build folders.
2. Run `npm run build`.
3. If you'd like to see a production build of the site, you can run `npm run serve`.
